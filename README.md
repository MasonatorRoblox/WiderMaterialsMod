# Wider Materials Mod
Allows you to modify the visual width of road, wood, steel, hydraulics, rope/cable, and springs, with separate values for (almost) all. This is a direct improvement to the Wider Roads mod.


### To change the width of a material:
Edit the corresponding value for that material.

### To save the width of a material for later use:
Click the "Save Preset" button in that material's row.
"Set All Presets To Current Width Values" will do this for all materials.

### To load the saved width of a material:
Click the "Load Preset" button in that material's row.
"Load All Presets" will do this for all materials.
